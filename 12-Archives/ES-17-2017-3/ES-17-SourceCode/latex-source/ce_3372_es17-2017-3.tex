\item Figure \ref{fig:SWMMCases} is a sketch of four different configurations.  All pipes have Manning's n $0.015$.  The invert elevations, pipe diameters, and pipe lengths are given on the sketch.   The input flows are $Q_1 = 20 \text{ CFS}$, $Q_2 = 66 \text{ CFS}$, $Q_3 = 110 \text{ CFS}$, at the indicated nodes.   The upper two cases have a \texttt{FREE} outfall downstream boundary condition; the lower two cases have a \texttt{FIXED} pool elevation boundary condition (pool elevation is $3.5$ feet).

   \caption{Four (4) cases to model in SWMM}
   \label{fig:SWMMCases} 
\end{figure}


Build a SWMM model that implements the four cases.  Once the model is functional, run the model for a 6-hour interval using \texttt{DYNAMIC WAVE} routing, and use the output conditions at hour 6 of the simulation to address the following list of tasks/questions.  Assume that the maximum depth at each \textbf{node} is 15 feet.

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item For Case 1 (Upper most condition), screen capture the profile plot. 
\item Which of the pipes in Case 1 are surcharged? 
\item What is the computed discharge in each pipe (from left to right)? 
\item For Case 2 (Second from top condition), screen capture the profile plot. 
\item Which of the pipes in Case 2 are surcharged? 
\item What is the computed discharge in each pipe (from left to right)? 
\item Does Case 2 have more unused capacity than Case 1? 
\item For Case 3 (Second from bottom condition), screen capture the profile plot. 
\item Which of the pipes in Case 3 are surcharged? 
\item What is the computed discharge in each pipe (from left to right)?
\item For Case 4 (Bottom condition), screen capture the profile plot.
\item Which of the pipes in Case 4 are surcharged? 
\item What is the computed discharge in each pipe (from left to right)? 
\item Does Case 4 have more unused capacity than Case 3? 
\item Explain the hydraulic advantage of matching the soffit (crown) elevations in contrast to matching the flow line (invert) elevations at a pipe diameter change.
