Cleveland This webook is a textbook-like document to accompany the class; it is simultaneously a textbook, and a content website. Description Theory and application of hydraulics, use of predictive tools such as design guidelines, charts and computer programs, for the analysis and design of water distribution and stormwater/wastewater collection and pumping systems. Preparation of reports and designs and presentations are additional components of this course. University Catalog Description CE 3372. Water Systems Design (3:3:0). Prerequesites: CE 3305, 3354. Hydraulic analysis and design of municipal water distribution, stormwater collection, and wastewater collection systems. Oral and written presentations. (Communications Intensive) Learning Activities Read, synthesize, and communicate ideas presented in current and historical technical literature. Perform flow and transport computation in simplistic topologies using JupyterLab (ENGR 1330) as needed. Perform flow and transport computation in realistic geometries using EPA-NET or similar professional tools for water distribution systems. Perform flow and transport computation in realistic geometries using SWMM 5.0 or similar professional tools for stormwater and wastewater collection systems. Size and select engineering materials (pipes, pumps, valves, etc.) for use in drinking water (water distribution), stormwater , and wastewater systems. Prepare preliminary engineering design reports for a drinking water distribution system, a stormwater collection system, and a wastewater collection system. Deliver design presentation(s) on selected preliminary engineering design(s). Computational Requirements WCOE has adopted JupyterLab as the computing environment within ENGR 1330; in the spirit of downstream application of Computational Thinking/Data Science, components of this course are being transitioned to that environment. A shared JupyterLab computing environment (Python and R enabled) is also provided through a navigation bar link. Network simulations will be conducted using EPANET 2.2 and SWMM 5.0 which are available for free from the US EPA website, or you can use the EPANET in a Box and SWMM in a Box shared environments.","title":"<p style=\"text-align:center\"> Water Systems Design </p>"},{"location":"#water-systems-design","text":"","title":" Water Systems Design "},{"location":"#a-webbook-to-accompany-ce-3372-at-ttu","text":"by Theodore G.
