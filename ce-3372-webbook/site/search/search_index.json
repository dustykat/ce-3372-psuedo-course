(Communications Intensive) Learning Activities Read, synthesize, and communicate ideas presented in current and historical technical literature. Perform flow and transport computation in simplistic topologies using JupyterLab (ENGR 1330) as needed. Perform flow and transport computation in realistic geometries using EPA-NET or similar professional tools for water distribution systems. Perform flow and transport computation in realistic geometries using SWMM 5.0 or similar professional tools for stormwater and wastewater collection systems. Size and select engineering materials (pipes, pumps, valves, etc.) for use in drinking water (water distribution), stormwater , and wastewater systems. Prepare preliminary engineering design reports for a drinking water distribution system, a stormwater collection system, and a wastewater collection system. Deliver design presentation(s) on selected preliminary engineering design(s). Computational Requirements WCOE has adopted JupyterLab as the computing environment within ENGR 1330; in the spirit of downstream application of Computational Thinking/Data Science, components of this course are being transitioned to that environment. A shared JupyterLab computing environment (Python and R enabled) is also provided through a navigation bar link. Network simulations will be conducted using EPANET 2.2 and SWMM 5.0 which are available for free from the US EPA website, or you can use the EPANET in a Box and SWMM in a Box shared environments.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#water-systems-design","text":"","title":" Water Systems Design "},{"location":"#a-webbook-to-accompany-ce-3372-at-ttu","text":"by Theodore G.

Introduction The title of the course is water systems design. The catalog description is: CE 3372. Water Systems Design (3:3:0).Prerequesite: CE 33051, 33542.Hydraulic analysis and design of municipal water distribution, stormwater collection, and wastewater collection systems. Oral and written presentations. (Writing Intensive) The general scope of the course is: - Examination of design guidance documents for drinking water distribution systems, a review of pipeline hydraulics, demand estimation, then a design project related to a drinking water distribution system. - The computer program EPANET is presented to provide a tool for the hydraulic modeling component of drinking water system design. - Examination of design guidance for stormwater collection systems, presents a review of open channel hydraulics (as related to storm sewers), capacity (hydrology) estimation, then a design project related to a stormwater collection system. - The computer program SWMM 5 is presented to provide a tool for the hydrologic/hydraulic modeling component of the stormwater collection system design. - Examination of design guidance for wastewater collection systems, then a design project related to a stormwater collection system. The graded components of the course are: - Quizzes (administered on a learning management system); individual activity - Exercises (collected on a learning management system); group activity - Exams (administered on a learning management system); individual activity - A design report (Three parts; collected on a learning management system); group activity - A design presentation (administered on a learning management system); group activity Water Systems Definition(s) The course title is Water Systems Design, so a natural question is what is meant by a water system? In this course it refers to a water distribution system that conveys raw or treated water to customers, a storm water collection system that conveys storm water away from infrastructure to reduce flooding damages and activities of daily life inconvenience,and wastewater collection systems that convey wastewater to treatment facilities for eventual release of the water back into the environment (or intentional reuse). Water systems can be classified into three main categories (Chin, 2006; Mays, 2011): 1. Water-control systems \u2013 to control the spatial and temporal distribution ofsurface runoff from rainfall events (drainage engineering). They can also servea use role if the captured rainwater is used later on for water supply (rainwaterharvesting). 2. Water-use system \u2013 to support human habitation and include water-treatmentsystems, water-distribution systems, wastewater-collection systems, and wastewater-treatment systems. 3. Environmental restoration system \u2013 to manage spatial and temporal distributionof water (quality and quantity) in support of non-human habitation. Water Control Systems Spatial and temporal distribution of surface runoff from rainfall events (drainage engineering) - Flood control - Storm water harvesting - Capacity is based on AREA served - Hydrologicaly dominated designs Water Use Systems Spatial and temporal distribution in support of human habitation - Water supply/treatment/distribution - Waste water collection/treatment/discharge - Capacity is based on POPULATION served - Hydraulically dominated designs Environmental Restoration Systems Systems to manage spatial and temporal distribution in support of non-human habitation - Create \u201cdesirable\u201d conditions - \u201cDesirable\u201d <= Policy <= Value Judgment Photo Essay of Some Water Systems This brief photo essay is adapted from \u201cHistorical Urban Water Systems\u201d by Dr. Robert Pitt, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 As we proceed through the tour, using the general definitions above, decide whether the picture represents a water control, water use, or environmental restoration system.","title":"Lesson 1 Introduction"},{"location":"lesson1/lesson1/#ce-3372-water-systems-design","text":"","title":"CE 3372 Water Systems Design"},{"location":"lesson1/lesson1/#lesson-1-introduction","text":"The title of the course is water systems design.
