## CE 3372 Water Systems Design

### Lesson 2. Course Specific Software

In this course we will use **EPANET** pipe network simulator software with the EPA supplied GUI, and **SWMM 5+** drainage network simulator software with the EPA supplied GUI.

This lesson demonstrates the installation on: 


### Installing EPANET

#### Check your system

EPANET with the GUI runs in the Windows environment and expects the underlying machine to be an x86-64 chipset.  Generally this means an Intel- or AMD-based machine.  

If you have a Chromebook or Raspberry Pi, or Macintosh EPANET as deployed from the EPA won't install directly.  You can try WINE or other emulators but **YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN!**. An alternative for these cases is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lightsail instance.  The \$12/month service will run both softwares, and works like ordinary Windows. 

#### Download the installer
