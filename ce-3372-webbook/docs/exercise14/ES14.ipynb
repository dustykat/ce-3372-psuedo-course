    "## Exercise \n",
    "\n",
    "Using your initial maps and conduit sizing from an earlier exercise (ES-12), which covers the same location, test the design using SWMM (Rossman, 2009) for a 5-yr, 6-hour storm applied to the entire study area. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can neglect the inlet specifications for your design and assume water that reaches the inlet will enter the sewer system (if it can). The design should include (provisional) drawings that specify the junction invert elevations at the different locations, the conduit diameters and flowlines, and the location of the hydraulic grade line for the design storm.\n",

    "## Deliverables:\n",

    "Submit a technical memorandum with screen captures of the relevant components above. Include a description of how the results were obtained and a discussion and interpretation of the results.  Show representative calculations where appropriate.  \n",
