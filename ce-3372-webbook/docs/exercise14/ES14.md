# ES-14

## Purpose:
Apply rational method conduit sizing to a small watershed.  

## Background

Figure 1 is a map showing storm drainage alignments and inlets location.  The figure shows land surface elevations in feet at the indicated locations. A distance scale is shown in the legend.

## Exercise 

Using your initial maps and conduit sizing from an earlier exercise (ES-12), which covers the same location, test the design using SWMM (Rossman, 2009) for a 5-yr, 6-hour storm applied to the entire study area. 

You can neglect the inlet specifications for your design and assume water that reaches the inlet will enter the sewer system (if it can). The design should include (provisional) drawings that specify the junction invert elevations at the different locations, the conduit diameters and flowlines, and the location of the hydraulic grade line for the design storm.
